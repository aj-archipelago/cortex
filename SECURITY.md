## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in Cortex, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue, as this might expose the vulnerability to others.
2. Please follow the GitHub process for [Privately Reporting a Security Vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)

## Disclosure Policy

Cortex follows responsible disclosure practices. Once a vulnerability is confirmed and a fix is developed, we will release a security update and publicly disclose the vulnerability. We will credit the reporter of the vulnerability in the disclosure, unless the reporter wishes to remain anonymous.

We appreciate your help in keeping Cortex secure and your responsible disclosure of any security vulnerabilities you discover.
