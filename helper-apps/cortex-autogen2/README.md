# Cortex AutoGen: Advanced AI Agent System ü§ñ

A robust, production-ready AI agent system powered by the AutoGen framework, designed for complex task automation and intelligent problem-solving. `Cortex AutoGen` processes tasks from Azure Storage Queues, orchestrating a diverse team of specialized AI agents to deliver real, verifiable results.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Dynamic Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Utilizes a `SelectorGroupChat` to dynamically select the most suitable agent(s) for each sub-task, enabling flexible and efficient workflows.
-   **Specialized Agent Team**: A comprehensive suite of agents, including:
    -   **Planner Agent**: Devises strategic plans for complex tasks.
    -   **Coder Agent**: Executes Python and shell scripts, performs computations, and creates local files.
    -   **File Cloud Uploader Agent**: Manages secure uploads of generated files to Azure Blob Storage, providing public SAS URLs.
    -   **Presenter Agent**: Formats and presents final results in professional Markdown, incorporating uploaded file URLs.
    -   **Terminator Agent**: Monitors task completion and signals termination.
-   **Real Code Execution & File Generation**: Agents are capable of running actual code, generating diverse file types (e.g., Python scripts, PDFs, images, presentations), and handling complex data processing.
-   **Azure Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Azure Storage Queue for task ingestion and Azure Blob Storage for file persistence.
-   **Real-time Progress Updates**: Provides live updates on task progress, including summarized current activities.
-   **Production-Ready & Scalable**: Engineered for reliable performance and capable of handling a continuous stream of tasks.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

`Cortex AutoGen` operates around a central `SelectorGroupChat` that orchestrates a team of specialized agents. When a new task arrives via the Azure Queue, the `Planner Agent` formulates an initial strategy. Based on the task's requirements, the `SelectorGroupChat` intelligently routes the sub-tasks to the most appropriate agent(s).

For example:
-   Data analysis tasks might involve the `Coder Agent`.
-   Any generated files are then handled by the `File Cloud Uploader Agent`, and the final polished output is prepared by the `Presenter Agent`.
The `Terminator Agent` ensures that all conditions for task completion are met before signaling the end of the process.

## üîß Tools & Capabilities

`Cortex AutoGen` provides a robust set of tools accessible to agents for task execution:

-   **Search Tools**:
    -   Bing Web, News, and Image Search: Real-time information retrieval with recency filters.
    -   Azure Cognitive Search: Specialized searches across Al Jazeera indexes (English, Arabic, Wires).
-   **Coding Tools**:
    -   Code Execution: Runs Python scripts with persistent environments.
    -   Shell Execution: Executes terminal commands for system operations.
-   **File Tools**:
    -   File Creation/Reading: Manages local files intelligently across types.
    -   File Listing/Info: Categorizes and analyzes files in the working directory.
-   **Download Tools**:
    -   File Downloads: Retrieves files from URLs with progress tracking.
-   **Azure Blob Tools**:
    -   File Uploads: Securely uploads files to Azure Blob Storage with SAS URLs.

These tools enable agents to perform web research, data processing, file management, and more.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.11+
-   Docker (for containerized deployment)
-   Azure Storage Account
-   Redis instance (for progress tracking)
-   API access for OpenAI/Cortex (for LLM models)
-   API access for Azure Cognitive Search and Bing Search (if using these capabilities)

### Installation

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd cortex-autogen2
pip install -e .
```

### Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials.
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Azure, Redis, OpenAI/Cortex, Cognitive Search, and Bing Search credentials.
```

### Running the Worker

**1. Clean up any existing workers (important to avoid conflicts):**
   ```bash
   pkill -f "python -m src.cortex_autogen2.main" || true
   ```
   *(This command stops any running Python processes related to `cortex_autogen2.main`.)*

**2. Run the worker (choose one):**

   **a) Using Docker (Recommended for Production/Local Development):**
      ```bash
      docker stop cortex-autogen2-worker || true && \
      docker rm cortex-autogen2-worker || true && \
      docker build -t cortex-autogen2 . && \
      docker run --name cortex-autogen2-worker \
                 --env-file .env \
                 -e REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING="redis://host.docker.internal:6379" \
                 -e CORTEX_API_BASE_URL="http://host.docker.internal:4000/v1" \
                 cortex-autogen2
      ```
      *(This command builds the Docker image, removes any old container, and then runs a new container in the foreground, passing necessary environment variables. Note: `host.docker.internal` allows the container to access services running on the Docker host.)*

   **b) Directly via Python (for local testing/development):**
      ```bash
      # Run a single task and exit
      CONTINUOUS_MODE=false python -m src.cortex_autogen2.main

      # Run continuously in the background (recommended for local development)
      CONTINUOUS_MODE=true python -m src.cortex_autogen2.main &
      ```
      *(For background execution, use `&`. To view logs, remove `&` or check your shell's job control.)*

### 3. Send a Task

Use `send_task.py` to push tasks to the Azure Queue:

```bash
# Basic task
python send_task.py "Generate a Python script to calculate the factorial of 15" --wait

# Request an article using Cognitive Search and Bing
python send_task.py "Write an Al Jazeera style article about the latest developments in AI ethics, including insights from academic papers (search Cognitive Index 'indexwires') and recent news (Bing search)." --wait

# Query the Al Jazeera SQL database for article counts
python send_task.py "How many published articles of type 'post' and 'video' were created in the last 30 days for Al Jazeera English (AJE)? Provide a daily breakdown and visualize it." --wait

# Request a presentation
python send_task.py "Create a visually stunning, detailed, and fun PowerPoint (.pptx) presentation about the most powerful Pok√©mon. The presentation should include: (1) an engaging cover slide, (2) individual slides for at least 8 of the most powerful Pok√©mon, each with vibrant images, key stats (type, abilities, base stats, signature moves), and fun facts, (3) a 'battle showdown' comparison slide using visuals and stats, (4) a conclusion slide. Output should be a downloadable .pptx file. Include references for images and data sources if possible." --wait
```
*(The `--wait` flag makes `send_task.py` wait for the worker to process and return the result.)*

## üîç How to Verify Real Execution and Results

The `Cortex AutoGen` system is designed for verifiable execution. Here's how to confirm its capabilities:

1.  **Code & Computation Verification**:
    -   Request complex mathematical calculations (e.g., prime numbers, factorials, statistical analysis).
    -   Ask for algorithms that require actual implementation and testing (e.g., sorting, data structure operations).
    -   Review the computed output for accuracy.

2.  **File & Data Verification**:
    -   For any task involving file creation (PDFs, images, presentations), ensure the `Presenter Agent` provides a **real, working public URL** from the `File Cloud Uploader Agent`.
    -   Download and verify the content of the generated files.
    -   For database queries, check that the SQL results and visualizations accurately reflect the requested data.

3.  **Content & Research Verification**:
    -   Verify the accuracy and proper referencing of facts.

## ‚ö° Performance & System Details

-   **Typical execution time**: Optimized for quick task completion.
-   **File Storage**: Automatic upload to Azure Blob Storage with temporary SAS URLs.
-   **Real-time Progress**: Updates are published via Redis for live monitoring.
