# Global expectations that apply to ALL test cases
global_expectations:
  - "CRITICAL FAIL (SCORE=0): If main requested deliverable is missing, score=0 regardless of other content quality"
  - "All files must have working SAS URLs and proper download links"
  - "Response must be FUN, ENGAGING, and PROFESSIONAL - complete user's request with insightful reply"
  - "MINIMAL BUT DETAILED: Every word adds value, no text dumps or link dumps"
  - "VISUALS FIRST: Rich visuals (charts, images, previews) integrated naturally with explanations"
  - "NO TEXT/LINK DUMPS: Never just list files or dump links - integrate everything into engaging narrative"
  - "EXPLANATIONS WITH VISUALS: Use visuals to explain, not replace explanation - combine both"
  - "COMPLETE THE CONVERSATION: Reply to user's request as if continuing a conversation, not just delivering files"
  - "PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION: Polished, error-free, consistent styling - what an expert would present"
  - "ENGAGING STORYTELLING: Use data insights, surprising findings, clear narratives to hold attention"
  - "FUN & DELIGHTFUL: Creative visualizations, interesting patterns, enjoyable experience while maintaining professionalism"
  - "File previews should appear before download links when available"
  - "All download links MUST open in new tabs (target='_blank') to prevent users from leaving the site"
  - "VISUALISTIC: Outputs should be visually rich with charts, images, previews, and visual elements that enhance understanding"
  - "ENGAGING: Content should be interesting, compelling, and hold user attention - use data insights, surprising findings, and clear narratives"
  - "PROFESSIONAL: All deliverables must meet professional standards - proper formatting, high-quality visuals, clear structure, polished presentation"
  - "FUN: While maintaining professionalism, outputs should be enjoyable and delightful - creative visualizations, interesting data patterns, engaging storytelling"
  - "CLICKABLE PREVIEWS: Preview images MUST be clickable (wrapped in anchor tags linking to main file download URL)"
  - "CLEAN FILENAMES: All download links MUST use clean, user-friendly filenames - remove timestamps, hashes, and system-generated prefixes (e.g., 'output_20251107T175133Z_4b471ed1.pdf' → 'output.pdf')"
  - "NO FILLER WORDS: Response must be direct and simple - no filler phrases like 'let me know!', 'if you'd like', 'just let me know', 'feel free to', 'don't hesitate to', or closing pleasantries"
  - "DIRECT & SIMPLE: Get straight to the point - every word must add value, no unnecessary phrases or pleasantries"
  - "ALWAYS SHOW PREVIEWS: If preview images exist, they MUST be displayed (not optional)"
  - "ALWAYS SHOW DATA VISUALS: If data/charts/graphs exist, they MUST be displayed immediately with explanations"
  - "DATA REQUIRES VISUALS: When there's data (CSV, JSON, statistics, analysis), visuals are ESSENTIAL - raw data is hard for humans to understand, so charts/graphs/visualizations must be created to make data accessible and understandable"
  - "CRITICAL FAIL (SCORE=0): If there's data and the response only describes what's visible without providing insights, patterns, surprises, or key findings, score=0. Data without insights is useless."
  - "INSIGHTS OVER DESCRIPTIONS: Do NOT just describe what users can see ('Here's a chart showing...', 'This visualization displays...'). Instead, provide INSIGHTS - what patterns, trends, surprises, or key findings emerge? Extract details that make users go 'wow'."
  - "MINIMAL TEXT, MAXIMUM INSIGHTS: Use as few words as possible but give maximum insights. Be direct and impactful. Answer 'So what?' - what does this data mean? What should users notice?"
  - "NO TEXT DUMPS: Forbidden phrases like 'Download Data & Visuals', 'Here's the data', 'Download the files below' - integrate links naturally into insightful narrative instead"
  - "PROFESSIONAL INSIGHTS: Responses must be pro, engaging, and insightful. Extract key details, surprising numbers, unexpected patterns, actionable insights. Don't repeat what's visible - provide value through insights."
  - "NO DUPLICATE IMAGES: CRITICAL FAIL (SCORE=0) - Each image URL must appear ONLY ONCE in the output. If the same image URL appears multiple times, score=0. Duplicate images waste space and create poor user experience."
  - "CRITICAL: NO 'DUMP OF IMAGES THEN DUMP OF TEXT' PATTERN - Output must weave images and insights together naturally. FORBIDDEN: Showing all images first, then all text below. REQUIRED: Start with key insight → show image → immediate insightful description → next image → immediate description → continue weaving. This creates natural, expert-level flow."
  - "EVERY IMAGE GETS INSIGHTFUL DESCRIPTION IMMEDIATELY AFTER: Each image (chart, preview, visualization) MUST be followed immediately by an insightful professional description (1-3 sentences). FORBIDDEN: Multiple images in a row without descriptions. FORBIDDEN: Saving all descriptions for the end. Each image needs its description right after it."
  - "START WITH KEY INSIGHT: Response must begin with the most important finding or deliverable, not generic intro like 'Here's your analysis' or 'I've analyzed the data'. Start directly with the key insight (e.g., 'Revenue spiked 40% in Q3, driven entirely by one product line')."
  - "EXPERT-LEVEL FORMATTING: Use bullet lists, numbered lists, bold text for emphasis, structured insights - make it feel like a 100-person expert team prepared this. Polished, comprehensive, but concise. Not verbose but includes every detail and key point."
  - "NATURAL FLOW: Images and insights must be woven together naturally throughout the response. No separation between visuals and text - they should flow together seamlessly (image → insight → image → insight)."
  - "CRITICAL FAIL (SCORE=0): DATA TASKS MUST HAVE VISUALS - For ANY task involving data (comparisons, analysis, trends, statistics, counts, CSV, JSON, database queries, article counts, etc.), charts/graphs/visualizations are MANDATORY. Text-only data analysis FAILS. If task mentions 'compare', 'analysis', 'trends', 'daily', 'counts', 'article counts', 'statistics', or similar data keywords, multiple charts (minimum 3 for comparison tasks) MUST be created and displayed. Data tasks without visuals score 0."
  - "MULTIPLE VISUALS REQUIRED FOR DATA TASKS: For comparison/analysis tasks (e.g., AJA vs AJE, comparing entities, analyzing trends), create SEVERAL charts showing different perspectives - minimum 3 charts: (1) line chart for time series, (2) bar chart for comparisons, (3) additional chart for another perspective. Single chart is insufficient for data tasks."
  - "VISUALS WITH INSIGHTS: Each chart/visualization MUST be displayed immediately followed by insightful description explaining what patterns, trends, or key findings the visual reveals. Charts without insights are incomplete."
  - "CRITICAL: OUTPUT MUST BE PURE MARKDOWN - NO HTML STRUCTURE (no <!DOCTYPE>, <html>, <head>, <body> tags). Use standard Markdown syntax for ALL formatting (# ## ### headers, **bold**, *italics*, lists, etc.). Use HTML <img> tags ONLY for images and HTML <a> tags ONLY for download links. NO CSS styling, NO <style> tags, NO HTML document structure. Theme compatibility is handled by the UI."
