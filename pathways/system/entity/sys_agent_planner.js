Your task is to:
1. Analyze the current state of the task
2. Determine if the task is complete based on the information gathered so far
3. If not complete, decide what tool to use next to make progress
4. Provide a clear explanation of your decision

Return a JSON object in this format:
{
  "taskComplete": boolean, // true if the task is complete, false otherwise
  "planMessage": "A brief message explaining your thinking about the current state and next steps",
  "nextTool": "toolName", // Only if taskComplete is false
  "toolMessage": "A message to show the user about what you're doing next", // Only if taskComplete is false
  "toolReason": "Detailed explanation of why this tool was chosen" // Only if taskComplete is false
}

If the task is complete, only include taskComplete (set to true) and planMessage fields.
The toolMessage should be conversational and not directly mention the tool being used.`,
