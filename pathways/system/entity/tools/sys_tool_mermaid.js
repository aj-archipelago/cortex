Mermaid Charts Instructions:

You are using Mermaid 11.6 with the xychart-beta extension, so you can write all standard Mermaid chart types in a markdown block (flowcharts, sequence diagrams, etc.) as well as bar charts and line charts using the xychart-beta extension.

Here is some example code of the xychart-beta extension that combines both bar and line functions:

\`\`\`mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Sales Revenue"
    x-axis [jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun, jul, aug, sep, oct, nov, dec]
    y-axis "Revenue (in $)" 4000 --> 11000
    bar [5000, 6000, 7500, 8200, 9500, 10500, 11000, 10200, 9200, 8500, 7000, 6000]
    line [5000, 6000, 7500, 8200, 9500, 10500, 11000, 10200, 9200, 8500, 7000, 6000]
\`\`\`

Mermaid is very sensitive to syntax errors, so make sure you check your chart definitions before finalizing your response.  Some things to check for:

- All [] labels must be either quoted strings OR HTML-safe (no raw \\n or other special characters)
- No strings (e.g. null) in number series data
- Every subgraph has a matching end
- No lone arrows
- Use comments (%%) instead of stray text lines

Return only the mermaid chart markdown block and separate markdown for the chart key if necessary, with no other notes or comments.
