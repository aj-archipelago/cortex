1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
Diablo 4 crossed $600 million of

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,120
revenue within the first five days

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,840
on the market. This has made Diablo

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,480
4 the fastest selling game of all

5
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,760
time for its developer and

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,840
publisher, Blizzard. Making it also

7
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,140
more popular than the previous

8
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,920
installments in the Diablo series,

9
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,780
reeling in many new players to the

10
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,220
ARPG genre altogether. While

11
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,920
reception for the game has been all

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,120
things considered generally

13
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,940
positive since launch, recently

14
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,120
players of the game have

15
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,660
increasingly become more negative

16
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,180
and less fond of Diablo 4. This is

17
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,880
partly a result of more and more

18
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,800
players reaching endgame, which in

19
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,440
its current state has some problems

20
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,060
that we will discuss in this video,

21
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,700
but for some also the realization

22
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,380
that Diablo 4 is an ARPG that draws

23
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,020
its long-term existence through

24
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,820
seasonal content, backed by the

25
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,640
idea that you make a new character

26
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,540
every season. Rod Ferguson, whom

27
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,160
oversees the Diablo franchise,

28
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,300
confirmed this as well in a tweet.

29
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,520
Responses to the tweet were very

30
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,440
mixed. For players familiar with

31
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,700
previous Diablo games and the ARPG

32
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:57,700
genre, Diablo 4 was a very popular

33
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,320
game. It wasn't anything new. This

34
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,960
seemed like obvious news, as they

35
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,640
have experienced similar systems in

36
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,000
the previous installments of the

37
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,700
franchise. But for the hordes of

38
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,980
new players that the game has

39
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,840
drawn, it did. Many couldn't even

40
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,660
believe that such a mechanic exists

41
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,600
in the first place or that it is in

42
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,380
this game. Some responses to Rod's

43
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,340
tweet went then as following. Gotta

44
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,980
be honest, as a new player, I don't

45
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,300
see myself grinding like this

46
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,660
again. If I have to start from

47
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,620
scratch for season 1, I'm likely

48
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,400
done maining Diablo. And I know

49
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,800
there's a ton of people in the same

50
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,480
boat. I care about my current

51
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,780
character. I'd just say... It if I

52
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,640
lost. This is not going to resonate

53
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,000
well with a lot of the more casual

54
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,560
players. You're turning off a large

55
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,700
percentage of the player base. Why

56
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,340
did I even start playing then? I

57
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,900
should have waited for season 1 to

58
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,640
start first. What a scam. I have

59
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,400
zero desire to start over again if

60
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,760
it means my character keeps

61
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,800
becoming useless. Well, it was a

62
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,300
cool few weeks. Diablo is a great

63
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,600
game. Unfortunately, developers

64
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,080
refused to make a better seasonal

65
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,800
system, so this game has officially

66
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,540
died for no reason other than

67
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,240
developers like torturing players.

68
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,540
Cool, so cool. I hope the game sees

69
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,860
a huge dip to force developers to

70
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,920
change this. And many more similar

71
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,680
type of responses could be found in

72
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,400
the thread. As you see, tension

73
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,240
would raise as a result of Rod's

74
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,860
tweets and it led to many outlets

75
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,540
covering the conversations that

76
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,920
took place on Twitter and informing

77
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,800
everybody that Blizzard confirms

78
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,720
the need to create a new character

79
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,960
every Diablo 4 season. Which in

80
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,480
turn was mocked by veteran players

81
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,880
since this seemed like it was

82
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,840
stating the obvious. Which in turn

83
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,900
lead to more heated discussions

84
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,440
about seasons in Diablo 4 in other

85
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,260
places. Making the subject of

86
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,000
seasons a trending topic for the

87
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,240
past few days. The main argument

88
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,700
from players that don't like the

89
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,720
seasonal system can be summarized

90
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,340
as following. If every few months

91
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,460
my character and with that all my

92
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,100
time and effort becomes completely

93
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,380
obsolete, then what's the point of

94
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,900
even playing? While players that

95
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,080
are familiar with seasonal content

96
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,100
and in fact enjoy seasons respond

97
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,620
to that that it's all about the

98
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,200
journey of leveling, gearing, and

99
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,880
making your game. And that's why

100
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:56,880
I'm here today. I'm here to talk

101
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:56,880
about the game. I'm here to talk

102
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,560
about the game. But when you take a

103
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,500
look at theory and terminology in

104
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:02,720
business, you'll actually find out

105
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,240
a lot less if you're a Rest

106
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,180
Following, like all apps out there,

107
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,680
here. But to really understand why

108
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,660
such a divide has transpired in the

109
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,260
first place, we need to understand

110
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,400
how seasons work. How seasonal

111
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,060
content works is that every season

112
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,580
you create a new character to

113
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,920
experience the season-specific

114
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,580
content of the current season that

115
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,140
is taking place. The seasons will

116
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,960
introduce new quests and lore, but

117
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,980
also specific season-bound concepts

118
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,840
and ideas that can change the way

119
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,420
you level, your gear, and

120
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,040
abilities. that you have. Generally

121
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,100
speaking these season specific

122
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,900
mechanics can for example lead to a

123
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,080
faster leveling process or a way

124
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,640
that makes you more overpowered

125
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,460
than is possible in the base game.

126
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,820
Aside from the season specific

127
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,000
content there's also a Diablo 4

128
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,100
battle pass which is tied to these

129
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,540
seasons. The battle pass can be

130
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,900
progressed by playing the seasons,

131
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,380
the free portion of the battle pass

132
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,720
can give you in-game advantages and

133
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,040
the paid portion of the battle pass

134
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,440
will in turn earn you cosmetic

135
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,440
items and things of that nature.

136
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,560
Your old characters do not get

137
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,960
deleted every time you start

138
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,820
playing a new season which seems to

139
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,020
be a common misconception

140
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,080
currently. Instead they will go to

141
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,940
the eternal realm which is also the

142
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,260
realm that currently all our

143
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,320
characters are on. You can still

144
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,180
play your old characters anytime in

145
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,920
any way you want if you wish but

146
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,240
just not with the new seasonal

147
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,060
content. While not having your old

148
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,860
characters deleted is a sign of

149
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,340
relief for a portion of the player

150
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,060
base that oppose the idea of

151
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,060
seasons there's obviously still the

152
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,700
overarching argument that making

153
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,140
new characters every season in

154
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,500
order for you to experience new

155
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,700
content still technically kills off

156
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,100
your previous characters because

157
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,920
you simply just can't use them to

158
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,820
experience the new content. On the

159
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,500
other hand new seasons can be a

160
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,080
good reason to try out a different

161
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,820
class, try out new builds and play

162
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,620
in a different way as a result of

163
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,040
the season specific content.

164
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,800
Generally season specific content

165
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,520
is meant to be a refresher with

166
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,900
some kind of twist to the gameplay

167
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,420
loop as at some point you have done

168
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,980
everything anyways regarding the

169
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,000
base game so this twist is meant to

170
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,740
give you a fundamentally new

171
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,940
gameplay experience. All in all you

172
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,420
could say that the divide is caused

173
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,520
by two fundamentally different

174
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,980
types of players. Those that are

175
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,320
attached to their character of

176
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,820
which obviously the idea of making

177
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,440
a new character every few months

178
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,080
isn't going to resonate well with

179
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,520
compared to those that are attached

180
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,860
to the journey rather and

181
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,340
essentially are what was previously

182
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,780
the dedicated Diablo 3 player base

183
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,160
so in a sense these will be the

184
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,320
core players that keep the game

185
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,280
alive. However Blizzard had a much

186
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,680
more aggressive campaign of

187
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,260
promoting the game compared to

188
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,800
previous games even endorsing

189
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,940
companies like KFC and mainstream

190
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,980
celebrities to make the game more

191
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,100
aggressive and more fun. And that

192
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,780
is good because Diablo 4 also

193
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,560
caters to this new population of

194
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,120
gamers as it's a very welcoming

195
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,320
game and not overly complicated to

196
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,180
get into. Thus it's only logical

197
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,760
that the grain draws an entire new

198
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,160
population of gamers that have

199
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,640
never played an ARPG before leading

200
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,480
into these new types of clashes

201
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,080
between different types of players.

202
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,760
The problems that some people have

203
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,460
with seasons might be exacerbated

204
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,240
by current problems plaguing Diablo

205
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,320
4 and the general state of endgame.

206
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,780
Which brings me to the next point.

207
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,760
Problems with endgame. The specific

208
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,220
portion of leveling that has been

209
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,040
described as bland and even tedious

210
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,820
by the community has mostly been

211
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,140
the leveling experience from level

212
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,840
70 to level 100 give or take. At

213
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,660
level 70 you will most likely have

214
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,760
world tier 4 unlocked and there's

215
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,060
not really much to look forward to

216
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,340
between level 70 and level 100. The

217
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,860
problem is really as simple as

218
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,480
that. At level 100 you obviously

219
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,740
have uberlith but those 30 levels

220
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,220
between 70 and 100 which do take a

221
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,840
significant time to level compared

222
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,480
to the first 70 levels is

223
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:24,980
essentially the same as the first

224
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,280
70. So you can't really get to

225
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,080
level 100 without the level 100.

226
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,760
Some elements that might contribute

227
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,500
to Diablo 4 endgame not feeling

228
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,420
meaningful might be that there is

229
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,380
no real reason to push high

230
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,860
nightmare dungeon tiers when

231
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,140
leveling or even at level 100 as

232
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,280
there is no reward structure

233
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,200
implemented that rewards you for

234
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,940
reaching said high tiers in the

235
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,700
first place. Then you can also get

236
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,040
a lot of your desired gear that is

237
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,920
the best for your build

238
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,420
specifically or almost the very

239
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,920
best at a relatively low level.

240
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,760
Really the moment you unlock world

241
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,320
tier 4. So that's So it could be as

242
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,840
early as level 70 to say level 75

243
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,260
which makes the gearing process

244
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,700
pretty mundane as well in that 70

245
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,560
to 100 bracket. When you have

246
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,020
already good ancestral gear with

247
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,260
your desired stats while you're

248
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,300
like level 75 what are you going to

249
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,920
be looking forward to in the next

250
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
25 levels? Upgrades to your already

251
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,740
good gear just boils down to small

252
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,540
percentages of increases to your

253
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,160
stats. It is not exciting.

254
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,660
Ultimately this problem is the

255
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,220
result of the loot tables being

256
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,920
just too random. You getting that

257
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,200
perfect ring that makes you never

258
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,780
look again at another ring from a

259
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,280
random easy weak mob that you

260
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,840
killed at like level 70 shouldn't

261
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,180
be a thing if you want to keep

262
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,200
itemization interesting from level

263
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,700
70 to 100. That fourth primary

264
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:32,700
emotion you get when you get

265
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:32,700
Guardage to climb that tower while

266
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:32,960
you're at level 77. At the same

267
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,440
time the current loot tables don't

268
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,180
reward you for doing more difficult

269
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,040
content. That enemy that oneshots

270
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,800
you in a Nightmare dungeon isn't

271
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,580
more interesting to loot than a

272
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,640
random enemy that you oneshot. And

273
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,800
yes, there is a really good chase

274
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,620
item that you can grind for but

275
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,900
they are so rare that you will

276
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,720
never see them anyways. What also

277
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,260
won't see is you becoming a,"Den

278
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,080
ellos no institution truly powerful

279
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,860
as you getting stronger is offset

280
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,560
by the enemies that scale with you

281
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,560
as you level. Naturally thanks to

282
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,700
how scaling works in this game. Not

283
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,160
to mention that classes are not

284
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,560
balanced. Some classes only have

285
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,000
one viable end game build while

286
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,720
others have multiple. And then the

287
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,040
build diversity for these classes

288
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,980
in itself is also just too sparse.

289
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,540
You will see that a lot of players

290
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,360
are catering to one specific build

291
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,920
style for their class and the

292
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,620
numbers do reflect that. So there's

293
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,300
also a discrepancy to be found

294
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,140
there in regards to class balance.

295
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:19,860
What isn't balanced

296
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,200
either is the need to do the

297
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,020
renowned grind every single season

298
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,440
which many players have been vocal

299
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,880
about and generally the renowned

300
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,660
grind has been described as tedious

301
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,920
and egregious but thankfully we can

302
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,120
cut down a bit on the renowned

303
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,720
grind as you don't have to do all

304
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,320
of it for example the alters of

305
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,760
Lilith are permanently unlocked

306
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,580
once you get them and they will

307
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,160
also stay active for your new

308
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,760
characters so it could be something

309
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,280
to work on if you haven't unlocked

310
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,860
them yet the alters of Lilith

311
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,580
provide individually small bonuses

312
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,100
but if you unlock all 160 of them

313
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,720
then communitlately speaking these

314
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,240
alters will provide you extra

315
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,860
useful stats for your character

316
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,020
that can for example help out in

317
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,620
getting paragon requirements of

318
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,280
rare nodes as well as provide you a

319
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,120
nice boost for any new character

320
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,440
and the map will also stay

321
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,960
uncovered once you have export all

322
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,540
of it for all your future

323
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,080
characters so while there's a

324
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,580
significant portion of the renowned

325
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,700
that you will have to do every

326
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,340
single season at this point in time

327
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,580
these two elements have been

328
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,820
confirmed to transfer over to new

329
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,540
characters and with that make the

330
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,300
renowned grind a bit less tedious

331
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,860
is it enough to fulfill the player

332
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,980
base regarding the renowned grind?

333
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,040
all together knowing that you will

334
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,340
for instance still have to do a

335
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,980
bunch of side quests scattered all

336
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,380
over the map every season well

337
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,960
opinions on that vary but this is

338
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,560
currently the state of the renowned

339
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,840
grind now while the last few

340
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,020
minutes might sound a bit

341
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,740
pessimistic the good news however

342
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,420
is that everything i just mentioned

343
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,740
can be fixed relatively easily i

344
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,360
will be giving some examples that i

345
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,700
think that personally could work

346
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,300
out nightmare dungeons can get much

347
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,920
better loot and rewards by fixing

348
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,780
the loot tables classes can be

349
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,880
balanced by tweaking numbers

350
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,480
obviously that is a good thing but

351
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,800
balancing and new play styles

352
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,640
emerging happens all the time in

353
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,080
these type of games new content

354
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,000
gated behind higher levels or even

355
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,920
world tier 5 which apparently clues

356
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,720
for existing have been datamined

357
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,800
can be introduced at say level 85

358
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,880
which can be an incentive to keep

359
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,280
leveling and make that leveling

360
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,800
process from level 70 to 100 more

361
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,440
fun as there will be something to

362
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,640
actually look forward to halfway in

363
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,480
that leveling bracket that would

364
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,560
then also make gearing more

365
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,680
exciting again between 70 and 100

366
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,660
as a new world tier means that we

367
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,240
can obtain a lot more content and

368
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,240
we can also get a lot more content

369
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,240
from the player as well as the

370
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,080
player can obtain a new type of

371
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,860
gear that is an upgrade to the best

372
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,280
gear that we currently already can

373
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,420
obtain as low as say level 70

374
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,460
regarding scaling the solution here

375
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,040
might be from the player instead of

376
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,800
a complete overhaul of the current

377
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,560
system the paragon boards hold a

378
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,860
lot of power that you will notice

379
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,240
as you get into very high level

380
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,800
brackets there are a bunch of these

381
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,200
types of nodes that increase your

382
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,860
power multiplicatively and getting

383
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,440
multiplicative increases as

384
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,600
indicated by the x in the end game

385
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,140
is a huge source of power

386
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,220
that you can actually get from the

387
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:50,220
paragon boards and it's a lot

388
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:50,720
easier to get from the paragon

389
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,340
boards than say world tier 2 as for

390
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,640
those that are leveling in low

391
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,400
levels you will notice more of the

392
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,100
scaling as you can get these type

393
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,000
of power increases from the paragon

394
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,260
boards all in all i think two

395
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,540
current main aspects that is making

396
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,160
the community mad can be tied

397
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,980
together if leveling in itself

398
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,540
becomes more fun and the problems

399
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,020
with the game are worked on as the

400
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,480
highest priority then that could

401
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,720
mean that there will also be

402
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,160
generally less problems with the

403
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,980
idea of her starting every season

404
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,100
for both seasons as well as new

405
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,120
players if leveling is fun and

406
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,680
something to look forward to then

407
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,200
generally speaking more and more

408
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,640
people will be willing to do it

409
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,340
every season if leveling is tedious

410
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,020
and boring then why would you want

411
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,380
to level once let alone every

412
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,880
season the developers have

413
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,200
announced that big balance patches

414
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,940
are coming which can be the start

415
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,660
of a positive trend of the game

416
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,620
becoming better and better if the

417
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,960
developers listen to the variety of

418
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,460
complaints continue to improve the

419
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,020
game across the board then that

420
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,940
could only mean that we're

421
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,400
currently playing the worst version

422
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,420
of diablo 4. all in all we should

423
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,940
probably wait longer before we draw

424
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,960
major conclusions about the game

425
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,080
and the game itself if you're not a

426
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,220
fan of the game then you should

427
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:49,220
definitely check out the video

428
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:49,220
description for more details about

429
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,940
diablo 4 being optimistic however

430
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,600
is not a bad idea at all

431
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,760
considering it's not just a

432
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,400
coincidence that the game reached

433
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,440
its current popularity in the first

434
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:57,800
place
